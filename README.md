# docker-daleksay

A Docker container with a talking Dalek. This is a completely functional and utterly useless Docker container, mainly useful for demo purposes.

## Instructions

If you are going to use it several times,

	sudo docker pull jjmerelo/daleksay
	
and then

	sudo docker run -it --rm  jjmerelo/daleksay Destroy
	
There are many critters avaiable. If you feel adventurous

	sudo docker run -it --rmjjmerelo/daleksay -f aardvark Ants are friends

Or even using the stoner version

    sudo docker run -it --rm jjmerelo/daleksay -f cow -s Hey ya

## Source for everything

This program is based in the old cowsay, and called for no reason critterhey. Check it out at http://github.com/JJ/critterhey
